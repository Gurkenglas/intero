# intero 

The intero project has reached the end of its life cycle. ðŸŒ‡ 

* I will not be maintaining it any longer.
* Minimal pull requests will be accepted for a few months.
* After which, I will archive the project.

If an individual or group would like to fork take over the project, they are welcome to do so. I will update this README to point to those alternatives.

Alternatives:

* [Dante](https://github.com/jyp/dante)
* [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)
* [ghcide](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide)
